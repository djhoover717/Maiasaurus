Describing exoplanetary system architectures comparing systems detected via transits and radial velocities

This project builds on the previous analysis of Gilbert & Fabrycky (2020), "An information theoretic framework for classifying exoplanetary system architectures" (https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.11098). Source code for that antecedent project can be found at https://github.com/gjgilbert/maiasaurus.
